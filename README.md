This project is a prototype of an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system built on blockchain tech.  
The system ensures that:
- Only authorized medical professionals (doctors, pharmacists, psychiatrists, etc.) can add new medical records.
- Records are immutable (cannot be deleted or edited).
- Patients can access their medical history securely with ID and password .
- Data includes prescriptions, medical check-ups, surgeries, hospitalization, ICU history, and allergy records.

By using blockchain, the system provides **security, transparency, and trust** in managing health records.


Software used:
- Solidity (Smart Contracts) – Define logic for immutable health records.
- Remix IDE – Write, compile, and deploy smart contracts.
- Metamask – Wallet for authentication and blockchain transactions.
- Ganache – Local Ethereum blockchain for testing with dummy ETH.
- IBM Granite AI – AI-assisted code generation for Solidity.
- Google Colab – Used for prompting AI to generate smart contract code.
