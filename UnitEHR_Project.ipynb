            "\n",
            "1. **Structs**:\n",
            "   - `Patient`: Contains patient details and an array of records.\n",
            "   - `Record`: Contains details of each health record including type, documents hash, description, addedBy (address of the professional), place, timestamp, and optional allergy info.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Mapping**:\n",
            "   - `patients`: Maps patient IDs to `Patient` structs.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Modifiers and Functions**:\n",
            "   - `onlyAuthorizedRole`: A placeholder modifier to check if the caller is an authorized role (doctor, pharmacist, etc.).\n",
            "   - `isAuthorizedRole`: A placeholder function to determine if the provided address is an authorized role.\n",
            "   - `addRecord`: Function to add a new record, enforcing authorization and ensuring the patient exists.\n",
            "   - `getPatientRecords`: Function to retrieve all records for a given patient ID.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Immutability**:\n",
            "   - Records cannot be deleted or edited once added, as Solidity smart contracts are immutable by design.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Off-chain Storage**:\n",
            "   - Documents are assumed to be stored off-chain (e.g., IPFS, decentralized storage), and only their hashes are stored on-chain for verification and integrity.\n",
